* TODO
** Friction Points
*** High Priority
    - lua snip is not working
    - expand / contract code blocks +1

*** Low Priority
    - lazy git should use current instance of neovim?
    - config notes vs notes config (cn/nc)
    - config find vs find (in) config
    - neorg task status cycle order
    - oil.nvim is it really vinegar worth?
    - telescope horizontal split mapping

** Projects
   - write implementation notes for open AI plugin for neovim
   - add lsp name to status line

** Ugly Shits
   - show lsp name in the status line
   - make lsp spinner faster
